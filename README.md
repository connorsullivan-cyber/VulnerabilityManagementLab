<h1>Vulnerability Management Lab</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo)

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project I will explore vulnerability scanning and vulnerability remediation. 


1. I will be using Nessus Essentials to scan a local virtual machine on VMWare Workstaion that will run credentialed scans to discover vulnerabilities. 
2. After discovering the vulnerabilities, I will then remediate them.
3. Once the vulnerabilities are remediated, I will rescan to verify the remediations.
<br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Nessus Essentials</b> 
- <b>VMWare Workstation</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b> 

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

<b>Launch the virtual machine:</b> <br/>

<br />
<br />
<b>Disable default firewall:</b>  <br/>
In order for Nessus to be able to scan the virtual machine, we will need to disable the default firewall of the Windows virtual machine. We will do so by opening up the Windows Defender Firewall properties and setting the firewall state to off for each tab (Domain, Private, Public). <br/>
We can ensure that the machine is able to be scanned by opening up the command line on our own computer and pinging to the virtual machine's ip. <br/>

<br />
<br />
<b>Setup first scan</b> <br/>
Now that our virtual machine is able to be accessed, we will launch Nessus and create our first scan! We can do this by going to New Scan > Basic Network Scan and then typing the ip address of our virtual machine in the target box. <br/>
<br />

<br />
After running the scan, we can go to the vulnerabilities section to see the results. <br/>

<br />
<br />
<b>Prepare virtual machine for credentialed scans<b/>  <br/>
Now that we have run our first scan and gotten a view of the vulnerabilities, we will now set up the machine to be able to run a credentialed scan. A credentialed scan is a more thorough scan of the system that uses admin privileges.
The first thing we will need to do is open up services (type services.msc into the search bar) and enable the Remote Registry. This will allow Nessus to go through the system and look for vulnerabilities. <br/>
